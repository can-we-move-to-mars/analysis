If we trash Earth, we can just move to Mars, right?

Anyone who reads news websites and social media has surely seen predictions that humanity will soon be moving into space.  In particular, the SpaceX venture by Elon Musk has generated a lot of media coverage with its goal of getting humans specifically to Mars.  Partly for the challenge, and partly because we might be burning out Earth pretty soon.
</p>
<p>
A small part of me wants to buy into this. I grew up listening to dinner time conversations with Apollo project scientists and engineers.  I remember watching Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon, on the black and white television of a neighbor who was a NASA scientist and who had invited everyone over on that historic day in 1969.  My childhood was filled with a sense that anything was possible, and that we were on the cusp of humanity moving to the stars.

</p>
<p>
But like a good Apollo engineer, let us set aside visionary things for a moment, and work out what’s required, to a level of confidence good enough to make design decisions.

</p>
<p>
Let’s do the math on leaving Earth. 
</p>
<p>

In fact, let’s keep it as easy as possible, and not even try to do the math on moving to Mars.  Let’s just see what it would take to move a substantial number of people – let’s say one billion - into the easiest to achieve near space existence.  This would match some visions that call for a phased move into space, first into orbit, then maybe the moon, and so on.

</p>
<p>
For this I understand that not everyone will want to follow each calculation, and it’s not necessary to grasp the most important conclusions.  I’ve put my calculations in a Google documents spreadsheet, here:   https://bit.ly/3MZ145O.  Links to sources of data used are within that spreadsheet as well. 

</p>
<p>
I’ve used an approach called Fermi estimation, which has been found very useful in different settings.  With Fermi estimation, one uses available facts, common sense and rough estimates of quantities to compute a value that’s good enough for planning and decisions. The big benefit of Fermi estimation is that one doesn’t have to be precisely right.  One just needs to get an answer that is within an order of magnitude (powers of ten) of what a precise answer would be.  An example of a Fermi estimate would be determining if a new consumer product will be about as expensive as a cup of coffee, or a microwave oven, or a car.

</p>
<p>
I’ve used Fermi estimations at work for years with excellent results.
</p>
<p>

So, let’s assume (for now) that we are enthusiastic project managers for the mission to move some of humanity off of Earth.  All we need to do is calculate useful estimates so that the real work can get started. 
</p>

<h3>
Even optimistic assumptions yield sobering results
</h3>
<p>
In those calculations -- which anyone can pull down from the link above to fiddle with, etc. -- there are some important assumptions, which I’ll list here in some detail because it’s important for clarity and avoiding misunderstandings.  One can skip over this numbered list to jump to the conclusions, of course.

</p>
<p>

Basically these assumptions rest on techno-optimism to create a spartan existence in space:
</p>
<p>
	<ol type="1">

<li>    The number of humans to move is 1 billion – enough to ease some of the pressure on Earth</li>
<li>	For this exercise, let’s be very, very optimistic. Wherever possible, we’ll err on the side of things somehow working out in our favor.</li>
<li>	Let’s go for the very easiest objective, moving to Earth orbit.  Critically, that stays within Earth’s magnetic field that protects us against radiation, and allows working with a familiar amount of solar energy for growing food, generating solar energy, etc.  Not that it matters for our math, but we’d probably go for von Braun’s rotating space wheel concept to create artificial gravity, as gravity is key to human and plant health.</li>
<li>	Since we don’t have even the beginning of alternative forms of space travel worked out, or any sort of laboratory demonstration of possible feasibility for new ways to get into space, we must assume the use of rockets powered by chemical reactions. Either kerosene-based fuels or liquid hydrogen.  Or possibly methane (more on that later).</li>
<li>	We’ll use the cheapest proven rocket technology for our estimate, which is the SpaceX Falcon Heavy lifter. </li>
<li>	Just to entertain what might someday be possible, we’ll also do a second estimate using the best possible efficiency for a proposed future lifter, the potentially game-changing SpaceX Starship.  </li>
<li>	The craft used to each lift several hundred humans into orbit won’t return to Earth. Rather, they’ll be re-purposed to be part of the growing space colony in orbit. So every launch will be a one-way trip, as each vehicle becomes part of the orbiting space colony.  These one-way lifters we will envision as having very roughly similar size, mass, and cost as an Airbus A380 aircraft.</li>
<li>	Perfect and infinite recycling of water, waste, etc. within the space colony is assumed.</li>
<li>	Minimal human physical needs are assumed. Among other things, this means a 100% vegan diet, without a lot of calories to spare, and an average personal living space about the size of a first-class passenger pod in an airliner.</li>
<li>	Assume that the vast majority of the humans sent up won’t need space suits of any kind.  Also, allow only 25 kilograms to each person for all personal belongings.  And the average weight of each human is 80 kilograms (176 pounds).</li>
<li>	Optimistically assume that problems on space stations such as wear and tear, and materials fatigue from alternating hot sun/deep cold are manageable.  This is indeed optimistic, as the safe lifespan of modules in the International Space Station is about 25 years.</li>
<li>	Psychology and mental health is ignored.  Realistically, this would be a monstrous mistake, but again, for this exercise let us adopt an attitude that everything will somehow work out.</li>

	</ol>
</p>
<p>
Clearly these assumptions are incredibly optimistic.
</p>
<p>
	
With those assumptions out of the way, let’s pick out the highlights of the modeled results.
</p>
<p>

Using conventional kerosene-type rocket fuels, and the known oil reserves of the planet, we’d need 6.4 Earths to create enough rocket fuel to lift 1 billion humans into orbit.  One must have liquid oxygen along with the fuel, and for that we’d need 3750 years’ worth of normal worldwide O2 production.  Assuming aluminum is the key building material, we’d need 1640 years’ worth of worldwide aluminum production.  
</p>
<p>

That kerosene fuel would create a lot of CO2: it would be 92 years’ worth of current worldwide human CO2 (currently about 37 gigatons a year).  In other words, one would have the equivalent of a century of extreme climate change emissions, just from rocket launches.  
</p>
<p>

Another way to look at this hypothetical project is financial cost, which is a decent proxy for overall effort.  This move off of Earth of 1 billion people to low earth orbit is modeled as requiring the entire world economy’s current output for 3882 years.  
</p>

<h3>
Could we plan on promised technology to make this better?
</h3>

<p>
We can re-run this basic model for the very best-case scenario.  The biggest problem in the modeled results is the cost of launching things into Low Earth Orbit (LOE).  The SpaceX venture has been keenly focused for years on making launches as cheap and practical as possible. The SpaceX Starship has a long-term aspirational goal of $10 per launched kilogram (again, details in our spreadsheet at https://bit.ly/3MZ145O).  Starship in a best-case world would use methane, and solar-powered plants to create that methane and re-capture the carbon produced from launches.  If all that pans out, it would be possible at $10 a kilogram to bring down overall cost to about 27 years output of the entire world economy.  

</p>
<p>
But let’s be clear: even in this very best case, we are talking about transforming every good and service produced by humans in every continent to something consumed by this hypothetical space venture.   That means that every bushel of wheat harvested, every iron nail made, every kilowatt of power produced, and so on -- all of the usual production of goods and services that we depend on every day, on every continent -- would be taken away.  For 27 years. 
</p>

<h3>
Where does this leave us? 
</h3>

<p>
It would seem that moving 1 out of every 8 humans just a small distance away from Earth would require a literally unimaginable amount of effort and resources.  The opportunity cost – in other words, what we would end up *not* doing, to be able to embark on this move -- would be incalculably high.
</p>
<p>

Let’s not kid ourselves either about the side effects of resource extraction, processing, and rocket launches.  These side effects would likely degrade Earth’s overall biome significantly, directly impacting life for the remaining humans in serious, perhaps irreparable ways.  This could easily be a mortal blow for the Earth as we know it.
</p>
<p>

In short, this is madness.  It is dangerous folly to pin humanity’s hopes for this century on leaving Earth behind.  
</p>
<p>

There are some counterpoints one can imagine. Chiefly two:
</p>
<p>

	<ol type="1">
<li>	“But you underestimate the ability of humanity to invent incredible new things!  People thought flying was impossible, and look at us now!”</li>
<li>	“We don’t need to move that many people to space.  We just need to move a few settlers”</li>
	</ol>
<p>
To the first point, I’d recommend looking to the past for clues about the cycle of new technology adoption.  How often do truly revolutionary advances in technology come about, and how long does it take to mature those advances to where they are consistently reliable and useful for widespread daily use?  If one looks at past breakthroughs, such as steam engines, airplanes and automobiles, electricity, and space flight itself, it appears to take between 30 and 50 years from invention to widespread feasibility.  With every major breakthrough, there are safety issues to work out, reliability issues to work out, and typically a lot of lessons learned the hard way with injuries and deaths.  Adopting the mindset of a good Apollo engineer -- failure is not an option! -- the most realistic thing to assume is that if tomorrow there was a breakthrough in space launch systems or propulsion, it would take the better part of half a century before it was really working right on a large scale.  That is not soon enough to save humanity from the multiple crises rushing toward us on this planet.
</p>

<p>
Even if we saw some truly unprecedented breakthrough, which made moving things into Earth orbit trivial, the resources required to build an airtight, sustainable space colony for a large number of people would still be prohibitive.  Far better to just build that high tech bubble for humanity on the Earth’s surface, where it’s much easier (that might, in fact, turn out to be humanity’s Plan C, or Plan D, if we really screw up this planet).
</p>
<p>
To the second point – that it’s not necessary to move so many people into space -- well, then by definition we won’t be overcoming limits to living on Earth.  An astute person will realize that the core problem is that one billion (humans) is a big number, and this big number drives the shocking estimates discussed above.  But this big number underscores the crux of the problem: just getting one hundred humans to space or another planet changes nothing for humanity as a whole.

</p>
<p>
This brings up a potential third point, relaxing ethical standards: Could we just say, that’s too bad for 99.9999% of humans, and we should focus on the possible start of a new human civilization somewhere else?  At least the human species would survive, right?
</p>
<p>

But that third point doesn’t stand up well upon reflection. The cost to make Earth healthy and whole for everyone is trivial compared to the cost required to move even just a tiny fraction of humanity permanently into space. It’s not even a remotely close call as to which path offers a better return on investment.  We need to heal the home we already live in.
</p>

<h3>
Final thoughts, and a better way
</h3>

<p>
Someday, humanity may in fact be able to live not just on Earth.  But that will work best if we are supremely ready, with scientific knowledge and technical abilities that would seem god-like to us today.  If I had to make a guess as to when we will be ready, I would say it is probably going to be a number of centuries from now.  Living in space is hard – the medical problems alone keep multiplying faster than the solutions.  For humanity to entertain the idea of moving to the stars, we must first keep our civilization intact long enough to vastly increase our knowledge and abilities.  
</p>

<p>
It’s not hard to see where this all ends up.  For those who dream of space exploration and settling new worlds, in the style of futuristic fantasies, the single most important step to take in the 21st century is to ensure that we don’t first burn out the spaceship we already live on.  
</p>

<p>
To be quite specific: if we wish to become a space-faring species millennia from now, we must in this century, relatively soon, be well on our way to a <a href="https://steadystate.org/">steady state economy</a>. We are going to need several centuries of improving our knowledge and abilities, while living within the resource and waste budget of Earth.  For me, the child who dreamed of space exploration is disappointed, but the grown-up respects and accommodates math and reality.
